> Samples of bucklescript's ReasonMl transpils to javascript 

**Why ? ** Because it's important to know how your code will be generated. It's also usefull when you create some bindings or also when you start coding with `ReasonML`.

## Development

```bash
yarn install
```

To create a new sample, you can use the boilerplate [here](src/0_Sample)

* Create your folder prefixed with the correct number, the format is snaked case based.
* Inside create a *reason* file 
* Run the npm task `yarn run readme`.
* That's it. Commit, Push and thanks !

Note: if you add a `.md` file (markdown), it will be print at the top of your generated section.
